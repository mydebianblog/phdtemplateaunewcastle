\section{Some good ideas about writing your thesis in LaTeX}

Well, since we are technical people, it goes without arguing that
the thesis is going to be written in LaTeX, and not in that
dumbed-down pointy-clicky behemoth for office plankton called MS
Word/OpenOffice. The fact is: Word/Openoffice is useful for small,
insignificant, unstructured and unimportant documents. LaTeX, on
the other hand, is a powerful programming language for technical
people and their complex, well-structured, math-ridden and
picture-rich documents.

The following tips and tricks can (and will!) save you countless
sleepless nights and oceans of tears:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  separate each chapter of your thesis in a separate file, and then
  use \verb+\input{myfile}+ command to link then in a master document
  \emph{thesisPhD.tex}
\item
  put pictures in a separate subdirectory/subfolder, preferable
  splitting them chapter-wise;
\item
  pick up either dvips or pdflatex, and don't mix them!
\item
  use \textbf{bibtex} or \textbf{natbib} for all your citations, it
  will save you countless buckets of tears;
\item
  use version control system (Subversion/Mercurial/Git/whatever -
  they are FREE!) with LaTeX to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    be able to roll back any change or recover a
    section/chapter/paragraph at your advisor's second thought (aka
    ``you know, a month ago we had a section here that it looked really nice\ldots{}'')
  \item
    to backup your whole thesis (especially true with distributed
    version control systems like Mercurial or Git) and sync your work
    between home/uni;
  \item
    to upload the code into a private repository on the Web (yet
    another backup).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  use bug/issues tracking capabilities in GitHub.com or bitbucket.com
  to flag the areas to discuss / improve.
\end{itemize}
\ldots{} and the rest of ideas from your thesis advisor.




\section{Tables}
An example of a simple table is provided below in Table~\ref{tab:example}. You may use \verb+booktabs+ package for more advanced/beatiful tables.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcr}
	23121 & 1212 & 232 \\ \hline  
	cat & frog & dog
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\caption{An example of a table}

\end{table}

See Table~\ref{tab:example}.
