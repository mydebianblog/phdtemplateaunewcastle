\section{Some good ideas about writing your thesis in LaTeX}

It goes without arguing that the Ph.D.~thesis in hard science
\emph{must} be written in LaTeX, and not in that dumbed-down
pointy-clicky behemoth MS Word/OpenOffice for office plankton.

The fact is: Word/Openoffice is useful for small, insignificant,
unstructured and unimportant documents. LaTeX, on the other hand,
is a powerful programming language for technical people and their
complex, well-structured, math-ridden and picture-rich documents.

The following tips and tricks can (and will!) save you countless
sleepless nights and oceans of tears:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  separate each chapter of your thesis in its own file, and then use
  \verb|\input{myfile}| command to link then in a master document
  \emph{thesisPhD.tex}
\item
  put pictures in a separate subdirectory/subfolder, preferable
  splitting them chapter-wise;
\item
  pick up either dvips or pdflatex,
  and don't mix them!
  The difference:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    use \textbf{dvips} if you have a lot of vector figures (from
    Gnuplot, for example) and vector graphics (in EPS format). You can
    always convert them to PDF using a command: \verb|epstopdf  foo.ps|
  \item
    use \textbf{pdflatex} in all other cases (if you don't need to
    convert your work to rtf/doc, or you don't know what EPS is).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  use \textbf{bibtex} or \textbf{natbib} for all your citations, it
  will save you countless buckets of tears
\item
  use the \verb|\label| command in LaTeX wisely:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    give names to different items with appropriate prefixes, e.g.,
    \verb|\label{eq:maxwell}| is a better reference to the Maxwell equations
    than \verb|\label{123}|
  \item
    use a colon (:) for references in chapters and sections, like
    \verb|\label{chap:intro:sec:review}|
  \end{itemize}
\item
  use version control system (Subversion/Mercurial/Git/whatever -
  they are FREE!) with LaTeX to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    be able to roll back any change or recover a
    section/chapter/paragraph at your advisor's second thought (aka
    ``you know, a month ago we had a section here that it looked really nice\ldots{}'')
  \item
    to backup your whole thesis (especially true with distributed
    version control systems like Mercurial or Git) and sync your work
    between home/uni;
  \item
    to upload the code into a private repository on the Web (yet
    another backup).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  use bug/issues tracking capabilities in GitHub.com or bitbucket.com
  to flag the areas to discuss / improve.
\end{itemize}
\ldots{} and the rest of ideas from your thesis advisor.


\section{Mathematics}
Any \textit{good} thesis contains at least some mathematical expressions. 

In optimization we want to minimize or maximize an objective function over a set of decision variables sbject to constraints. There are different ways to format optimization problems, but the preferable way is to follow an excellent book ``Convex Optimization'' by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. A general optimization problem has the form:

\begin{equation*}
 \begin{aligned}
 & \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}
 & & f_0(x) \\
 & \text{subject to}
 & & f_i(x) \leq b_i, \; i = 1, \ldots, m.
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

If we want to perform quadratic programming, the notation will be the following:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qpoptimisation}
 \begin{aligned}
 & \underset{x}{\text{minimize}}
 & & J(x) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}^T Q \mathbf{x} + c^T \mathbf{x} \\
 & \text{subject to} 
 & & A\mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf b \mbox{  (inequality constraint)} \\
 & 
 & &     E\mathbf{x} = \mathbf d  \mbox{  (equality constraint)}
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Eq.\ref{eq:qpoptimisation} is a rather sophisticated \LaTeX formulae. Unlike the tabular environment, in which you can specify the alignment of each column, in the aligned environment, each column (separated by \verb|&|) has a default alignment, which alternates between right and left-aligned. Therefore, all the odd columns are right-aligned and all the even columns are left-aligned.




\section{Tables}
An example of a simple table is provided below in Table~\ref{tab:example}. You may use \verb+booktabs+ package for more advanced/beatiful tables.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcr}
	23121 & 1212 & 232 \\ \hline  
	cat & frog & dog
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\caption{An example of a table}
\label{tab:example}
\end{table}

See Table~\ref{tab:example}.


\section{Pictures}
An example picture is in Fig.~\ref{fig:examplepic}. You may also use floating figures with wrap-around (use the \verb|wrapfig| package, although they often create a lot of troubles.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{phd101310s}
\caption{An example picture.}
\label{fig:examplepic}
\end{figure}

Also you may consider a \verb|subfig| package if you want to put figures side-by-side and reference them separately (like Fig. 3a or Fig.3b).





\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}\label{chap:summary}



\appendix % all \chapter{..} commands after this will generate appendices

\chapter{This appendix should get a letter}
\label{app:example}
An appendix before the backmatter gets an automatically generated letter by
which it can be referred to. This is Appendix~\ref{app:example}.

\chapter{Simulation Source Code}
You may want to investigate the \texttt{lgrind} program and package if you
wish to include source code in your thesis

\backmatter % start the thesis back matter - the numbering of chapters stops here.



\chapter{Last Thing} % Appendices after the \backmatter command do not  get a letter
This sort of appendix has no letter.
